# Project-2 Group 3 Twitter Big Data Analysis

## Twitter data analysis proposal
We would like to explore questions about a popular Korean pop (“Kpop”) artist, BTS from Twitter, while also looking at the other Kpop groups and some information on other pop in America

## Specific Questions to Answer

- **How is #BTS distributed globally? (Mindy Jen)**

## Resposibilities

-  Learn/Understand Twitter API
-  Learn/Understand Spark/Scala (and other useful technologies and frameworks related to our project)
-  Create queries related to our questions
-  Execute queries and analyze
-  Create Google slides for the presentation 
-  Practice Presentation

- Spark SQL
- YARN
- HDFS and/or S3
- Scala 2.12.10
- Twitter API

## Twitter Data Query

## Twitter Data Analysis: List of features 

* List countries where twitter users are located. ![fig1](https://github.com/renjmindy/project-2/blob/mindy/pic/0213_morning_fig1.png)
* Count languages which twitter users from different countries are used in their texts. ![fig2](https://github.com/renjmindy/project-2/blob/mindy/pic/0213_morning_fig2.png)
* Identify languages to which the country, where twitter users are located, corresponds. ![fig3](https://github.com/renjmindy/project-2/blob/mindy/pic/0213_morning_fig3.png)    

## TODOs for future development

* Word Counting (optional for project 2, will do in project 3)
* Twitter Data Modeling using Machine Learning (optional for project 2, will do in project 3)
